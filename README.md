nwns
=====

nwns is an Ncurses Wireless Network Scanner which displays nearby wireless network SSIDs, MAC addresses, and channels. It utilizes libnl, a collection of libraries providing APIs to the Netlink protocol based Linux kernel interfaces. Because Netlink is a Linux-specific protocol, nwns will only work in Linux operating systems. nwns is tested on Arch Linux.


Getting Started
===============

nwns can be compiled with the included Makefile:

```
    make
```

Compile and install to /usr/sbin/:

```
    sudo make install
```

Uninstall:

```
    sudo make remove
```

Usage
=====

nwns must be run as root

Pass your wireless interface as the first parameter when runnings nwns:

```
    sudo nwns wlan0
```

If no interface is specified, nwns will attempt to use wlp3s0 as the interface.
